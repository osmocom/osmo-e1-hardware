[[gateware]]
== icE1usb Gateware

The icE1usb _gateware_ is where pretty much everything happens,
from the E1 Line Interface Unit to the E1 Framer/Deframer, the
picoRISCV soft-core running the [[firmware]] as well as the USB
device peripheral talking to the host PC.

As an OSHW project, all of it is available in source code format
at https://git.osmocom.org/osmo-e1-hardware/tree/gateware/icE1usb

Please use `git clone --recursive` when cloning the git repository
so you get all of the sub-modules for the various soft-cores.
